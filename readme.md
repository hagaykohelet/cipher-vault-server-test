i choose in supabase cause i feel its more functional

the endpoint /api/auth/register is for register users only one for name and save in mongodb



 the second route /api/messages/encrypt for encrypt a message and save it in supa base and increase a count in mongodb only users that stored in mongodb
the username and password send in headers


the endpoint /api/messages/decrypt 
for decrypt a message by message id only users that stored in mongodb
the username and password send in headers

the endpoint /api/users/me

the given in headers is a name and password and tsend the username and count of message decrypt count
